            <p>I will guide and coach you step by step to overcome past experiences, fears, or thoughts that overwhelm you and limits your future opportunities. Achieving lasting results in only a few weeks, not years, with some fears and phobias released in just a few hours. Unlike other forms of therapy, my approach will not require you to relive the past or even share the details of those events</p>
            <p>The techniques I use are profoundly effective and gentle. I see my clients release the pain of their past experiences and negative thoughts and watch as a sense of calm washes over them. Life-altering changes happen quickly and permanently!</p>
            <p>I am a certified Master Neuro Linguistic Programming Practitioner, with a certification in Time Line TherapyÂ®, as well as a practitioner of hypnotherapy. In addition, I am certified as a core transformation and wholeness coach.</p>
            <p>I work with my clients over a span of three months and sessions are conducted via video call or in person</p>
